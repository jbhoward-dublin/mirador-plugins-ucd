## Link to FromThePage 

```linktoFromThePage_ucd.js```

Determines whether manifests loaded to Mirador have been imported to the [FromThePage transcription platform](http://fromthepage.com/) then presents a userButton to link to the resource on that site.

To enable it, include the JavaScript linktoFromThePage_ucd.js (**after** loading Mirador):

```html
<script src="{plugin_path}/linktoFromThePage_ucd.js"></script>
```
(Also creates links to the DÃºchas.ie transcription site for IIIF manifests representing stories from the Schools' Collection, National Folklore Collection UCD.)
